# Particle_Projects
Particle Photon projects repo

New Repo for Particle Photon projects - will follow similar logic to other repos

Current Folders:

Hello World - contains simple ino file for blinking LEDs

Soil Moisture - lots of subfolders due to the Particle ADAM offline IDE creating folders all on its own all the damn time...
  - HelloWorld - duh - it blinks LEDs
  - SM_Prototype_Code - first prototype code for the soil moisture readings
  - SoilMoisture - the current codebase for the Photon and Soil Moisture probes
