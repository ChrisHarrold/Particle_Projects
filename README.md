# Particle_Projects
Particle Photon projects repo

New Repo for Particle Photon projects - will follow similar logic to other repos

Current Folders:

  - Hello World - contains simple ino file for blinking LEDs
  - SM_Prototype_Code - first prototype code for the soil moisture readings
  - SoilMoisture - the current codebase for the Photon and Soil Moisture probes
  also has subdirs due to the Particle ADAM offline IDE creating folders all on its own all the damn time...
    - Prototype - this is the .ino file I am working with
    - src - ADAM created - not sure what's in it I just leave it be...
